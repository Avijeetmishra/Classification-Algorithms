Project 3: Classification Algorithms

Discription:In this project, we have implemented three classification algorithms: Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and
Naïve Bayes also Random Forest and boosting on Dicision Tree.

To directly execute the code, go to "Project3\Code\Project3\WindowsFormsApplication2\bin\Debug" and run "Project3.exe" 

Instructions
* The file "Project3.sln" is present in the "Project3' folder.
* Open the file in Microsoft Visual Studio.
* Build the solution by selecting 'Build->Build Solution'.
* To run the file click on start.
* Here dropdown lists are present which lets the user select the constraints.
* Clicking on a Classify,runs the algorithm which gives all the validation parameters.
